    <h1>CSV2MYSQL: Heuristic Creation of MySQL Tables and Load Scripts</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many interesting data sets are distributed as "comma-separated
      value" (<tt>.csv</tt>) files.&nbsp; If they are large (e.g., they
      exceed the capabilities of a spreadsheet program), it is
      convenient to load them into a relational database so that SQL
      queries can be used to explore them.&nbsp; The tool described here
      reads a set of such files and heuristically produces a set of
      MySQL table definitions and <tt>LOAD DATA</tt> statements that,
      if sourced in MySQL, will import the data.&nbsp; Because of its
      heuristics, it requires little or no guidance in determining the
      appropriate column data types, though there are options specifying
      whether the input files contain header lines, whether blank
      columns are to be treated as <tt>NULL</tt>, whether the text
      encoding is <tt>UTF8</tt>, and whether <tt>UNIQUE KEY</tt>
      constraints are to be sought. It is also possible to specify the
      format of the <tt>.csv</tt> file by giving the comma, quote and
      escape characters.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This program is released under the MIT License (see below) and
      uses the <b>opencsv</b> package, documented at <a
        href="http://opencsv.sourceforge.net">http://opencsv.sourceforge.net</a>.&nbsp;











      Its code is included in the program.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Using the Program</h2>
    <p>Csv2mysql is implemented in Java, built in Eclipse.&nbsp; Eclipse
      can create a runnable <tt>.jar</tt> file, which can then be
      invoked as<br>
    </p>
    <pre>java -jar csv2mysql.jar [options] file1 file2 ...</pre>
    <p>The following options are available:<br>

    </p>
    <h2>Heuristics</h2>
    <p>The program reads through all of the input data, one file at a
      time.&nbsp; Each file is processed separately, so there is no
      attempt to assure consistency among different tables.&nbsp; The
      data types that are recognized are described in the following
      sub-sections.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>NULLs</h3>
    <p>Empty fields in the input data are treated as NULL unless the <tt>-b</tt>
      option is given; in that case, it is treated as an empty string,
      and <tt>NULL</tt> must be denoted by <tt>\N</tt> or <tt>"\N"</tt>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If none of the entries in a column are <tt>NULL</tt>, we specify
      <tt>NOT NULL</tt> for the column.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Integers</h3>
    <p>An integer is an optional <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> sign
      followed by any number of the digits 0-9.&nbsp; (We have no
      provisions for any radix other than 10.) MySQL has multiple
      integer data types of different sizes:<br>

    We choose the column data type that minimally fits the range of
    values seen.&nbsp; If they are all non-negative, we choose <tt>UNSIGNED</tt>
    types.<br>
    <h3>Floating-point</h3>
    <p>A floating point value is specified as an optional sign, a series
      of digits with possibly one decimal point among them, optionally
      followed by <tt>E</tt>, an optional sign, and a series of digits
      representing the power of 10 in scientific notation. We choose to
      represent such floating point values as one of the following MySQL
      types depending on their range of values:<br>

    <br>
    Note that an integer can also appear in a floating-point field, but
    will be treated as floating-point if not all values in that field
    are integers.&nbsp; If all the values in a field fit within a <tt>FLOAT</tt>,
    that type will be selected; otherwise, <tt>DOUBLE</tt>.&nbsp; In
    principle, we could also support larger <tt>DECIMAL</tt> fields,
    but do not do so.<br>
    <h3>Date, Time and DateTime</h3>
    <p>MySQL provides Date, Time and DateTime data types, which we
      support.&nbsp; There is also a TimeStamp data type, but its range
      is much more limited than in other implementation such as Oracle,
      so we do not consider that possibility but use DateTime
      instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; If every value in a field is <tt>NULL</tt>
      or a valid Date, Time, or DateTime, then the field will be
      declared with that data type.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Dates are normally written as YYYY-MM-DD, though two-digit years
      or dates using / instead of - as a separator are also
      allowed.&nbsp; Times are written in 24-hour notation, as HH:MM:SS
      possibly followed by a decimal fractional second; the separators
      are either a colon, period or dash.&nbsp; A DateTime is a date
      specification followed by either a space or the character T,
      followed by a time specification.&nbsp; Invalid dates or times are
      not considered to be dates or times and will probably cause the
      field to be interpreted as a text field. Timezones are not
      handled.<br>
    </p>
    <p>As a special case, we also recognize dates and times in a format
      often used in exporting from Oracle, which is of the form
      15-jan-2015 14:30:25.&nbsp; That may be followed by a space and a
      time zone specificiation (e.g., EST).&nbsp; If a field
      consistently codes an Oracle style date, time or
      datetime/timestamp, we arrange to translate it on input into the
      SQL standard format, but ignore the time zone portion, if any.<br>
    </p>
    <h3> <thh valign="top">Character</thh></h3>
    <p>Data fields all of whose values cannot be parsed as any of the
      other data types are treated as character types.&nbsp; These may
      be surrounded by quotes but need not be, unless they contain
      characters (such as quotation marks) that can confuse the
      reader.&nbsp; MySQL supports various lengths of character
      fields.&nbsp; We use the following:<br>

    <p>We choose the field that is minimally able to store all values of
      a field.&nbsp; For convenience, we also output the longest value
      as a comment in the table definition.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Unique Keys</h3>
    <p>If requested, we test to see whether every value (except <tt>NULL</tt>)
      in a column is distinct.&nbsp; If so, we create a <tt>UNIQUE KEY</tt>
      constraint for that column.&nbsp; If a column has all integer or
      floating-point values, we test for distinctness by actually
      converting each value into the corresponding type. This is because
      although "001" and "1" are distinct as strings, they are identical
      as integers.&nbsp; (The -z option handles this specific problem by
      treating integers that begin with 0 as strings.) Similarly, "3"
      and "3.0" are the same floating-point value.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We are able to maintain efficiently a representation of many
      distinct integer values if they are dense enough to allow us to
      represent them as a tree of ranges, which can be merged when they
      meet.&nbsp; This is often the case for identifiers or serial
      numbers.&nbsp; Because other data types are not "dense" in this
      sense, we must actually keep all distinct values in order to find
      a non-unique one.&nbsp; This explodes memory for very large
      tables, so we limit to a maximum number of distinct values for
      each column (see <tt>-m</tt> [default 1M]). Because the program
      stops looking for duplicates after that limit, it cannot determine
      whether a column can have a <tt>UNIQUE KEY</tt>, so it assumes
      not.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <p>The above heuristics may not create the intended data
      types.&nbsp; For example, some coding systems do distinguish
      between codes "001" and "01", but if every code in a column can be
      interpreted as an integer, this program will do so and thus lose
      these distinctions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The program also cannot determine which among the <tt>UNIQUE KEY</tt>s
      should be a table's <tt>PRIMARY KEY</tt>, or whether compound
      keys need to be defined to reflect the semantics and/or access
      patterns to the data.&nbsp; It is also unable to identify <tt>FOREIGN











        KEY</tt> constraints.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Using the -k option asks the program to retain all values in each
      column so that it can check if those values are unique.&nbsp;
      Although it stops doing so for any column as soon as the first
      duplicate is found, the memory demands for a very large table with
      one or more unique columns can be huge.&nbsp; Therefore, in such
      cases it is necessary to start the Java Virtual Machine with
      non-default memory parameters that can accommodate the large hash
      tables and range trees that hold these values. Obviously, this
      must be run on a system with enough memory.&nbsp; For example, on
      one very large table containing about 250M rows, the following
      worked (though these <tt>jvm</tt> arguments may have provided
      more memory than needed):<br>
    </p>
    <pre>java -Xms5128m -Xmx10512m -jar ~/bin/csv2mysql.jar -k -u test.csv</pre>
    <p>Even with extra memory, performance on very large data sets
      becomes abysmal.&nbsp; Thus, rather than using the <tt>-k</tt>
      option, it may be more sensible to run without it, load the data
      into the database system, and then check to see whether all values
      are distinct using its facilities.&nbsp; If so, <tt>ALTER TABLE</tt>
      can create the <tt>UNIQUE KEY</tt> constraints.<br>
